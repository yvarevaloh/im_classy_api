# Liveness Detection Lab

This repository born as development of a liveness detection system. Its main purpose is to explore model testing and deployment, including flask configurations.

But, I'm not working alone. I'm sharing this experience with skilled people:
* Yeimy Arebalo - DS
* David Alizalde - Angular Dev
* Ana Borda - Visual Designer and UX
* Amer Salgado - Angular Dev
